# Gallery_Cafe
The proposed web application for The Gallery Cafe aims to create a seamless digital experience, enhancing customer interaction and operational efficiency. Drawing from similar web designs like CultureColombo.lk, SusieCakes.com, and CostaVida.com, the website will incorporate clean, visually engaging layouts and user-friendly functionality tailored for a restaurant setting. Key features include a vibrant homepage highlighting promotions, a detailed About Us page to establish brand connection, an interactive menu categorized by cuisine types, and a reservation system with real-time availability and pre-ordering options. Users will have the ability to register, save preferences, and streamline their dining experience. The system will also support specific roles for Admin and Operational Staff, allowing the management of reservations, menu updates, and promotions, ensuring a smooth and responsive service model.
